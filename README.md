# Numerical-Analysis-Methods
* This repository contains python scripts/programs where it can represent a tabular data for root finding.
* Currently under development with methods in finding the roots of a function.
* Root Finding Methods include: _Open Methods_, _Bracketing Methods_, etc.
* Newton-Raphson Method currently not available

* Numerical Methods Include:
  * **_FPI.py_** (Fixed-Point Iteration Method)
  * **_BIS.py_** (Bisection Method)
  * **_RF.py_** (Regula-Falsi Method/False Position Method)

* Please do take note that the input of a function **_f(x)_** or **_x_** should always be like this:
  * f(x) = 3xÂ²+2x+4, the input should be **3\*x\*\*2+2\*x+4**
